# Reborn to be Wilde: Une approche de transfert stylistique textuel par l’affinage d’un modèle massif de langage

## Description

This project pioneers the finetuning of the `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1` model for stylistic transfer, aiming to replicate the distinctive writing style of Oscar Wilde with enhanced narrative capabilities. By implementing an authorship attribution classifier based on BertAA, we establish a baseline to measure our success in mimicking Wilde's style. Our ultimate goal is to deceive the classifier into recognizing language model-generated texts as authentic works of Wilde.

## Installation

No specific installation steps are required to explore this project. However, for running the model and classifier, ensure you have an appropriate Python environment set up with necessary libraries.

## Usage

Detailed usage instructions will be provided soon. Stay tuned!
